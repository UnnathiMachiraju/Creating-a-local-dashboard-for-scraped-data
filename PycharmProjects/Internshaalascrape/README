This is a very basic project of scraping the Internshaala website and storing the data in a json file. The data stored is analysed and the top 10 profiles and top 10 locations of internship availability are displayed on a local dashboard.
1) First run Internscrape.py has the scraping code which stores data in static/data/location_count.json and static/data/intern_count.json
2) Next we run app.py which gets the stored data from their respective paths and sends it to a local dashboard for which we have an index.html file in templates and styles.css in static folder.
